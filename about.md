## Overview and Blog Purpose

The BAIR Blog provides an accessible, general-audience medium for BAIR
researchers to communicate research findings, perspectives on the field, and
various updates. Posts are written by [students][11], [post-docs][11], and
[faculty][10] in BAIR, and are intended to provide relevant and timely
discussion of research findings and results, both to experts and the general
audience. Posts on a variety of topics studied at BAIR will appear approximately
once every two weeks.
