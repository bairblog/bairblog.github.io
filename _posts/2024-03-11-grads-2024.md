These are comments in HTML. The above header text is needed to format the
title, authors, etc. The "example_post" is an example representative image (not
GIF) that we use for each post for tweeting (see below as well) and for the
emails to subscribers. Please provide this image (and any other images and
GIFs) in the blog to the BAIR Blog editors directly.

The text directly below gets tweets to work. Please adjust according to your
post.

The `static/blog` directory is a location on the blog server which permanently
stores the images/GIFs in BAIR Blog posts. Each post has a subdirectory under
this for its images (titled `example_post` here, please change).

Keeping the post visbility as False will mean the post is only accessible if
you know the exact URL.

You can also turn on Disqus comments, but we recommend disabling this feature.

Their work at BAIR, ranging from deep learning, robotics, and natural language processing to computer vision, security, and much more, has contributed significantly to their fields and has had transformative impacts on society.

This website is dedicated to showcasing our colleagues, making it easier for academic institutions, research organizations, and industry leaders to discover and recruit from the newest generation of AI pioneers. Here, you'll find detailed profiles, research interests, and contact information for each of our graduates. We invite you to explore the potential collaborations and opportunities these graduates present as they seek to apply their expertise and insights in new environments.
