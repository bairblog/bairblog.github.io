<!--
These are comments in HTML. The above header text is needed to format the
title, authors, etc. The "example_post" is an example representative image (not
GIF) that we use for each post for tweeting (see below as well) and for the
emails to subscribers. Please provide this image (and any other images and
GIFs) in the blog to the BAIR Blog editors directly.

The text directly below gets tweets to work. Please adjust according to your
post.

The `static/blog` directory is a location on the blog server which permanently
stores the images/GIFs in BAIR Blog posts. Each post has a subdirectory under
this for its images (titled `example_post` here, please change).

Keeping the post visbility as False will mean the post is only accessible if
you know the exact URL.

You can also turn on Disqus comments, but we recommend disabling this feature.

The actual text for the post content appears below.  Text will appear on the
homepage, i.e., https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/ but we only show part of the
posts on the homepage. The rest is accessed via clicking 'Continue'. This is
enforced with the `more` excerpt separator.

This is a template for [BAIR blog][1] posts. Here is an example image.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/example_post/image1.png" width="50%">
<br>
<i><b>Figure title.</b> Figure caption. This image is centered and set to 50%
page width.</i>
</p>

The content here after the excerpt separator will not appear on the front page
of the BAIR blog but will show in the post.

# Text formatting

Markdown provides text formatting such as **bold** and *italic*.

LaTeX is also supported, such as $y = \beta x + \alpha$ inline, or as a separate
line

$$y = \beta x + \alpha.$$

URLs can be inserted through square brackets, such as [this][1].

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/example_post/image2.png" width="30%">
<br>
<i><b>Figure title.</b> Figure caption. This image is centered and set to 30%
page width.</i>
