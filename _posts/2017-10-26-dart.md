Humans can tele-operate robots to perform complex tasks, such as performing
laparoscopic surgery, planting a garden, and driving a car. However, robots
under their own control have not been as capable. To bridge this skill gap,
Imitation Learning (IL) studies how to teach robots these complex behaviors by
instruction from a supervisor. 

In IL, a robot observes a supervisor performing a task and tries to recover
the behavior via Supervised Learning. For example, to teach a robot make a
bed, a human can tele-operate the robot to perform the task and provide
examples of what the robot should do at visited states. The robot can then
learn a mapping from states to the supervisor’s actions to generalize to new
states. 

A known issue with this Off-Policy approach, however, is that if the robot
makes a mistake during execution of its policy, it can significantly affect
errors downstream in the process. For example, if the robot fails to grasp the
sheet correctly, then it is much more likely to mess up stretching it out. A
common way to fix this issue is to use On-Policy methods, such as DAgger,
which allow the robot to make errors during learning so that it can receive
feedback on how to recover. However, On-Policy methods can have several
limitations such as: being difficult for human supervisors, potentially
dangerous, and computationally expensive. 

We present a robust Off-Policy algorithm called DART. In DART, data is
collected passively from the supervisor, but with small optimized noise
injected into the teleoperation system. The injected noise forces the
supervisor to provide corrective examples for the type of errors the trained
robot is likely to make.  However, because the optimized noise is small, it
alleviates the aforementioned limitations. 

We evaluate DART in  simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on MuJoCo tasks
(Walker, Humanoid, Hopper, Half-Cheetah) and physical experiments with human
supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform mechanical search, where a
robot must search through clutter for a goal object.  Finally, we show how
DART can be applied in a complex system that leverages both classical robotics
and learning techniques to teach the first robot to make a bed! For
researchers who want to study and use robust Off-Policy approaches, <strong>we
additionally announce the release of 
<a href="https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/DART/">our codebase</a>

# Imitation Learning's Compounding Errors

A common algorithm in IL is known as Behavior Cloning.  In Behavior Cloning, the
robot first observes the supervisor and collects its demonstrations (i.e.,
sequences of state and action pairs). The robot then uses Supervised Learning to
learn a function that maps the states visited to the supervisor’s actions.
Behavior Cloning is an Off-Policy algorithm because data is collected from a
policy different than the robot's learned policy. 

In the late 80s, Behavior Cloning was applied to teach cars how to drive, with a
project known as ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network). In
ALVINN, a neural network was trained on driving demonstrations and learned a
policy that mapped  images of the road to the supervisor’s steering angle.
Unfortunately, after learning, the policy was unstable, as indicated in the
following video:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/alvinn.gif" alt="ALVINN."><br>
<i>
ALVINN Suffering from Covariate Shift.
</i>
</p>

The car would start drifting to side of the road and not know how to recover.
The reason for the car’s instability was that no data was collected on the
side of the road.  During the data collection the supervisor always drove along
the center of the road; however, if the robot began to drift from the
demonstrations, it would not know how to recover because it saw no examples.

This example, along with many others that researchers have tried, shows that
Imitation Learning cannot be entirely solved with Behavior Cloning. In
traditional Supervised Learning, the training distribution is de-coupled from
the learned model, whereas in Imitation Learning, *the robot’s policy affects
what state is queried next*. Thus the training and testing distributions are no
longer equivalent, and this mismatch is known as 
<strong><a href="http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/jiang4/domain_adaptation/survey/node8.html">covariate shift</a></strong>.

To reduce covariate shift, the objective of Imitation Learning had to be
modified. The robot should now be expected to match the supervisor on the states
it is likely to visit. Thus, if ALVINN is likely to drift to the side of the
road, we expect that it will know what to do in those states. 

We can introduce a bit of math to help formalize this objective. A robot’s
policy and a supervisor’s policy can be denoted as $\pi_{\theta}$ and
$$\pi_{\theta^*}$$, where $\pi$ is a function mapping state to action and $\theta$
is a parametrization, like weights in a neural network.   We can measure how
close two policies are by what actions they apply at a given state, which we
refer to as the surrogate loss, $l$.  A common surrogate loss is the squared
Euclidean distance:

$$l(\pi_{\theta}(x), \pi_{\theta^*}(x)) = \|\pi_{\theta^*}(x)
-\pi_{\theta}(x)\|^2_2.$$

Finally, we need a distribution over trajectories  $p(\xi|\theta)$, which
indicate the trajectories, $\xi$, that are likely under the current policy
$\pi_{\theta}$.  Our objective can then be written as follows: 

$$ 
\underset{\theta}{\mbox{min}}\; E_{p(\xi|\theta)} \underbrace{\sum^T_{t=1}
l(\pi_{\theta}(x_t), \pi_{\theta^*}(x_t)) }_{J(\theta,\theta^*|\xi)}.
$$

Hence we want to minimize the expected surrogate loss on the distribution of
states induced by the robot’s policy. This objective is challenging to solve
because we don’t know what the robot’s policy is until after data has been
collected, which creates a *chicken and egg* situation. We will now discuss an
iterative On-Policy approach to overcome this problem.


# Reducing Shift with On-Policy Methods

A large body of work from Ross and Bagnell [6,7], has examined the theoretical
consequences of covariate shift. In particular, they proposed the DAgger
algorithm to help correct for it. DAgger can be thought of as an On-Policy
algorithm --- which rolls out the current robot policy during learning. 

The key idea of DAgger is to collect data from the current robot policy and
update the model on the aggregate dataset. Implementation of DAgger requires
iteratively rolling out the current robot policy, querying a supervisor for
feedback on the states visited by the robot, and then updating the robot on the
aggregate dataset across all iterations.

<i>

</i>
</p>

Two years ago, we used DAgger to teach a robot to perform **mechanical search
(shown below)**, which requires a robot to search through objects via pushing to
reach a desired goal object. Imitation Learning was advantageous in this task
because we didn’t need to explicitly model the collision of multiple non-convex
objects. 

<p style="text-align:center;">

alt="Mechnical Search 1." width="250" height="250"><br>
<i>
Planar Mechanical Search.
</i>
</p>

Our planar robot had a neural network policy that mapped images of the workspace
to a control signal. We trained it with DAgger on 160 expert demonstrations.
While we were able to teach the robot how to perform the task with a 90% success
rate, we encountered several major hurdles that made it challenging to increase
the complexity of the task. 

# Challenges with On-Policy Methods

After applying DAgger to teach our robot, we wanted to study and better
understand 3 key limitations related to On-Policy methods in order to scale up
to more challenging tasks. 

## Limitation 1: Providing Feedback

In order to apply feedback to our robot, we had to do so retroactively with a
labeling interface, shown below.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/feedback.gif" 
alt="Mechnical Search 2." width="250" height="250"><br>
<i>
Supervisor Providing Retroactive Feedback.
</i>
</p>

A supervisor had to manually move the pink overlay to tell the robot what it
should have done after execution. When we tried to retrain the robot with
different supervisors, we found it was very challenging to provide this feedback
for most people. You can think of a human supervisor as a controller that needs
to constantly adjust their actions to obtain the desired effect. However, with
retroactive feedback the human must simulate what the action would be without
seeing the outcome, which is quite unnatural. 

To test this hypothesis, we performed a human study with 10 participants to
compare DAgger against Behavior Cloning, where each participant was asked to
train a robot to perform planar part singulation. We found that Behavior Cloning
out-performed DAgger, suggesting that while DAgger mitigates the shift, in
practice it may add systematic noise to the supervisor’s signal [2].

## Limitation 2: Safety 

On-Policy methods have the additional burden of needing to roll-out the current
robot’s policy during execution. While our robot was able to perform the task at
the end of training, for most of learning it wasn't successful:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/policy_gif.gif" 
alt="Mechnical Search 3." width="250" height="250"><br>
<i>
Robot Rolling Out Unsuccessful Policy.
</i>
</p>

In unstructured environments, such as a self-driving car or home robotics, this
can be problematic. Ideally, we would like to collect data with the robot while
maintaining high performance throughout the entire process. 

## Limitation 3: Computation

Finally, when building systems either in simulation or the real world, we want
to collect large amounts of data in parallel and update our policy sparingly.
Neural networks can require significant computation time for retraining.
However, On-Policy methods suffer when the policy is not updated frequently
during data collection. Training on a large batch size of new data can cause
significant changes to the current policy, which can push the robot’s
distribution away from the previously collected data and make the aggregate
dataset stale. 

Variants of On-Policy methods have been proposed to solve each of these problems
individually. For example, Ho et al. got rid of the retroactive feedback by
proposing, GAIL, which uses Reinforcement Learning to reduce covariate shift
[8].  Zhang et al. examined how to detect when the policy is about to deviate to
a risky state and asks the supervisor to take over [4]. Sun et al. has explored
incremental gradient updates to the model instead of a full retrain, which is
computationally cheaper [5].

While these methods can each solve some of these problems, ideally we want a
solution to address all three. Off-Policy algorithms like Behavior Cloning do
not exhibit these problems because they passively sample from the supervisor’s
policy. Thus, we decided instead of extending On-Policy methods it might be more
beneficial to make Off-Policy methods more robust. 

# Off-Policy with Noise Injection 

Off-Policy methods, like Behavior Cloning, can in fact have low covariate shift.
If the robot is able to learn the supervisor’s policy perfectly, then it should
visit the same states as the supervisor. In prior work we empirically found in
simulation that with sufficient data and expressive learners, such as deep
neural networks, Behavior Cloning is at parity with DAgger [2]. 

In real world domains, though, it is unlikely that a robot can perfectly match a
supervisor. Machine Learning algorithms generally have a long tail in terms of
sample complexity, so the amount of data and computation needed to perfectly
match a supervisor may be unreasonable. However, it is likely that we can
achieve small non-zero test error. 

Instead of attempting to perfectly learn the supervisor, we propose simulating
small amounts of error in the supervisor's policy to better mimic the trained
robot. Injecting noise into the supervisor’s policy during teleoperation is one
way to simulate this small test error during data collection. Noise injection
forces the supervisor to provide corrective examples to these small disturbances
as they try to perform the task.  Shown below is the intuition of how noise
injection creates a funnel of corrective examples around the supervisor’s
distribution. 

<p style="text-align:center;">

<i>
Noise Injection forces the supervisor to provide corrective examples,<br>
so that the robot can learn to recover.
</i>
</p>

Additionally, because we are only injecting small noise levels, we don’t suffer
as many limitations compared to On-Policy methods. A supervisor can normally be
robust to small random disturbances that are concentrated around their current
action. We will now formalize noise injection a bit to help understand its
effect more. 

Denote by $$p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^*},\psi)$$ a distribution over trajectories with
noise injected into the supervisor's distribution
$$\pi_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x},\psi)$$. The parameter $\psi$ represents
the sufficient statistics that define the noise distribution. For example, if
Gaussian noise is injected parameterized by $\psi$, then
$$\pi_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x},\psi) =
\mathcal{N}(\pi_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{x}), \Sigma)$$.  Note, the stochastic
supervisor's distribution is a slight abuse of notation.
$$\pi_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x},\psi)$$ is a distribution over actions,
where as $$\pi_{\theta^*}(\mathbf{x})$$ is a deterministic function mapping to a
single action. 

Similar to Behavior Cloning, we can sample demonstrations from the
noise-injected supervisor and minimize the expected loss via standard supervised
learning techniques:

$$
\theta^R = \underset{\theta}{\mbox{argmin }} E_{p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^*},\psi)}
J(\theta,\theta^* | \xi)
$$

This equation, though, does not explicitly minimize the covariate shift for
arbitrary choices of $\psi$; the $\psi$ needs to be chosen to best simulate the
error of the final robot’s policy, which may be complex for high dimensional
action spaces.  One approach to choose $\psi$ is grid-search, but this requires
expensive data collection, which can be prohibitive in the physical world or in
high fidelity simulation. 

Instead of grid-search, we can formulate the selection of $\psi$ as a maximum
likelihood problem. The objective is to increase the probability of the
supervisor applying the robot’s control. 

$$
\underset{\psi}{\mbox{min}} \: E_{p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^R})} -\sum^{T-1}_{t=0} \:
\mbox{log} [\pi_{\theta^*}(\pi_{\theta^R}(\mathbf{x_t})|\mathbf{x_t},\psi)]
$$

This objective states that we want the noise injected supervisor to try and
match the final robot's policy. In the paper, we show that this explicitly
minimizes the distance between the supervisor and robot's distribution. A clear
limitation of this optimization problem though is that it requires knowing the
final robot's distribution $p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^R})$, which is determined only
after the data is collected.  In the next section, we present DART, which
applies an iterative approach to the optimization.

## DART: Disturbances for Augmenting Robot Trajectories

The above objective cannot be solved because $p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^R})$ is not
known until after the robot has been trained.  We can instead iteratively sample
from the supervisor's distribution with the current noise parameter, $\psi_k$,
and minimize the negative log-likelihood of the noise-injected supervisor taking
the current robot's, $\pi_{\hat{\theta}}$, control.

$$
\hat{\psi}_{k+1} = \underset{\psi}{\mbox{argmin}} \: E_{p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^*},
\psi_k)} -\sum^{T-1}_{t=0}\mbox{log} \:
[\pi_{\theta^*}(\pi_{\hat{\theta}}(\mathbf{x_t})|\mathbf{x_t},\psi)]
$$

The above iterative process can be slow to converge because it is optimizing the
noise with respect to the current robot's policy. We can obtain a better
estimate by observing that the supervisor should simulate as much expected error
as the final robot policy, $$E_{p(\xi|\pi_{\theta^R})}
J(\theta^R,\theta^*|\xi)$$.  It is possible that we have some knowledge of this
quantity from previously training on similar domains. In the paper, we show how
to incorporate this knowledge in the form of a prior. For some common noise
distributions, the objective can be solved in closed form, as detailed in the
paper. Thus, the optimization problem determines the shape of the noise injected
and the prior helps determine the magnitude. 

Our algorithm DART, iteratively solves this optimization problem to best set the
noise term. DART is still an iterative algorithm like On-Policy methods.
*Through the iterative process, DART optimizes $\psi$ to better simulate the
error in the final robot's policy.*


# Evaluating DART

To understand how effectively DART reduces covariate shift and to determine if
it suffers from similar limitations as On-Policy methods, we ran experiments in
4 MuJoco domains, as shown below. The supervisor was a policy trained with TRPO
and the noise we injected was Gaussian. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/ni_a_results-eps-converted-to.png"
alt="DART results."><br>
</p>

To test if DART suffers from updating the policy after larger batches, we only
updated the model after every $K$ demonstrations for all experiments. DAgger was
updated after every demonstration and DAgger-B was updated after every $K$.  The
results show that DART is able to have the same performance as DAgger, but is
significantly faster in terms of computation.  DAgger-B is relatively similar in
computation time, but suffers significantly in performance, suggesting DART can
significantly reduce computation time. 

We finally compared DART to Behavior Cloning in a human study for the task of
Mechanical Search, shown below.  In the task, a Toyota HSR robot was trained to
reach a goal object by pushing objects away with its gripper. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/hsr.gif"
alt="DART results."><br>
<i>

</i>
</p>

The task is more complex than the one above because the robot now sees images of
the world taken from an eye-in-hand camera. We compared 4 humans subjects and
saw that by injecting noise in the controller, we were able to receive a win
over Behavior Cloning of 62%. DART was able to reduce the shift on the task with
human supervisors. 

# Robotic Bed Making: A Testbed for Covariate Shift

To better understand how errors compound in real world robotic systems, we built
a literal test bed. Robotic Bed Making has been a challenging task in robotics
due to it requiring mobile manipulation of deformable objects and sequential
planning. Imitation Learning is one way to sidestep some of the challenges of
deformable object manipulation because it doesn’t require modeling the bed
sheets. 

The goal of our bed making system was to have a robot learn to stretch the
sheets over the bed frame. The task was designed so that the robot must learn
one policy to decide where to grasp the bed sheet and another transition policy
to decide whether the robot should try again or switch to the other bed side.
We trained the bed making policy with 50 demonstrations. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/bed_system.png"
alt="DART results, bed-making."><br>
<i>
Bed Making System.
</i>
</p>

DART was applied to inject Gaussian noise into grasping policy because we
assumed there would be considerable error in determining where to grasp. The
optimized covariance matrix decided to inject more noise in the horizontal
direction of the bed, because that is where the edge of the sheet varied more
significantly and subsequently the robot had higher error.

In order to test how large covariate shift was in the system, we can take our
trained policy $\pi_{\theta^R}$ and write its performance with the following
decomposition. 

$$
\begin{align}
E_{p(\xi |\pi_{\theta^R})} J(\theta^R,\theta^*|\xi) &= \underbrace{E_{p(\xi |\pi_{\theta^R})}  \sum^T_{t=1} l(\pi_{\theta}(x_t), \pi_{\theta^*}(x_t)) -  E_{p(\xi |\pi_{\theta^*}, \psi)}  \sum^T_{t=1} l(\pi_{\theta}(x_t), \pi_{\theta^*}(x_t))}_{\text{Shift}} \\
&+ \underbrace{E_{p(\xi |\pi_{\theta^*},\psi)}  \sum^T_{t=1} l(\pi_{\theta}(x_t), \pi_{\theta^*}(x_t)) }_{\text{Loss}},
\end{align}
$$

where the first term on the right-hand side corresponds to the covariate shift.
Intuitively, the covariate shift is the difference between the expected error on
the robot’s distribution and the supervisor’s distribution. When we measured
these quantities on the bed making setup, we observed noticeable covariate shift
in the transition policy trained with Behavior Cloning. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/dart/cs_graph.png"
alt="DART results, covariate shift." width="500"><br>
<i>
Covariate Shift in Bed Making Task.
</i>
</p>

We attribute this covariate shift due to the fact that with Behavior Cloning the
robot rarely saw unsuccessful demonstrations; thus the transition policy never
knew what failure was. DART gave a more diverse set of states, which allowed the
policy to have better class balance. DART was able to train a robust policy that
allowed it to perform the bed making task even when novel objects were placed on
the bed, as shown at the beginning of the blog post. When distractor objects are
placed on the bed DART obtained a 97% sheet coverage, whereas Behavior Cloning
achieved only 63%. 

These initial results suggest that covariate shift can occur in modern day
systems that use learning components. We will soon release a longer preprint on
the Bed Making Setup for more information.

DART presents a way to correct for shift via the injection of small optimized
noise. Going forward, we are considering more complex noise models that better
capture the temporal structure of the robot’s error.
