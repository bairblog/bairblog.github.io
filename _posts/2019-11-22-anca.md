Prof. Anca Dragan gave a talk as part of WIRED25 summit, explaining some of the
challenges robots face when interacting with people. First, robots that share
space with people, from autonomous car to quadrotors to indoor mobile robots,
need to anticipate what people plan on doing and make sure they can stay out of
the way. This is already hard, because robots are not mind readers, and yet
they need access to a rough simulator of us, humans, that they can use to help
them decide how to act. The bar gets raised when it's crowded, because then
robots have to also understand how they can influence the actions that people
take, like getting another driver to slow down and make space for a merging
autonomous car. And what if the person decides to accelerate instead? Find out
about the ways in which robots can negotiate these situations in the video
below.
