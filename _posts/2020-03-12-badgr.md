Look at the images above. If I asked you to bring me a picnic blanket in the
grassy field, would you be able to? Of course. If I asked you to bring over a
cart full of food for a party, would you push the cart along the paved path or
on the grass? Obviously the paved path.

Prior navigation approaches based purely on geometric reasoning incorrectly
think that tall grass is an obstacle (left) and don’t understand the difference
between a smooth paved path and bumpy grass (right).
</i>
</p>

While the answers to these questions may seem obvious, today’s mobile robots
would likely fail at these tasks: they would think the tall grass is the same
as a concrete wall, and wouldn’t know the difference between a smooth path and
bumpy grass. This is because most mobile robots think purely in terms of
geometry; they detect where obstacles are, and plan paths around these
perceived obstacles in order to reach the goal. This purely geometric view of
the world is insufficient for many navigation problems. Geometry is simply not
enough.

Can we enable robots to reason about navigational affordances directly from
images? We developed a robot that can autonomously learn about physical
attributes of the environment through its own experiences in the real-world,
without any simulation or human supervision. We call our robot learning system
BADGR: the Berkeley Autonomous Driving Ground Robot.

BADGR works by:

1. autonomously collecting data
2. automatically labelling the data with self-supervision
3. training an image-based neural network predictive model
4. using the predictive model to plan into the future and execute actions that will lead the robot to accomplish the desired navigational task

### (1) Data Collection

<p style="text-align:center;">

<br />
<i>

environments.

</p>

BADGR needs a large amount of diverse data in order to successfully learn how
to navigate. The robot collects data using a simple time-correlated [random
walk][1] controller. As the robot collects data, if it experiences a collision
or gets stuck, the robot executes a simple reset controller and then continues
collecting data.

### (2) Self-Supervised Data Labelling

BADGR then goes through the data and calculates labels for specific
navigational events, such as the robot’s position and if the robot collided or
is driving over bumpy terrain, and adds these event labels back into the
dataset. These events are labelled by having a person write a short snippet of
code that maps the raw sensor data to the corresponding label. As an example,
the code snippet for determining if the robot is on bumpy terrain looks at the
[IMU][2] sensor and labels the terrain as bumpy if the angular velocity
magnitudes are large.

We describe this labelling mechanism as self-supervised because although a
person has to manually write this code snippet, the code snippet can be used to
label all existing and future data without any additional human effort.

### (3) Neural Network Predictive Model

</p>

BADGR then uses the data to train a deep neural network predictive model. The
neural network takes as input the current camera image and a future sequence of
planned actions, and outputs predictions of the future relevant events (such as
if the robot will collide or drive over bumpy terrain). The neural network
predictive model is trained to predict these future events as accurately as
possible.

### (4) Planning and Navigating

(right).
</i>
</p>

When deploying BADGR, the user first defines a reward function that encodes the
specific task they want the robot to accomplish. For example, the reward
function could encourage driving towards a goal while discouraging collisions
or driving over bumpy terrain. BADGR then uses the trained predictive model,
current image observation, and reward function to plan a sequence of actions
that maximize reward. The robot executes the first action in this plan, and
BADGR continues to alternate between planning and executing until the task is
complete.

<hr>

In our experiments, we studied how BADGR can learn about physical attributes of
the environment at [a large off-site facility near UC Berkeley][3]. We compared
our approach to a geometry-based policy that uses [LIDAR][4] to plan
collision-free paths. (But note that BADGR only uses the onboard camera.)

BADGR successfully reaches the goal while avoiding collisions and bumpy
terrain, while the geometry-based policy is unable to avoid bumpy terrain.
</i>
</p>

We first considered the task of reaching a goal GPS location while avoiding
collisions and bumpy terrain in an urban environment. Although the
geometry-based policy always succeeded in reaching the goal, it failed to avoid
the bumpy grass. BADGR also always succeeded in reaching the goal, and
succeeded in avoiding bumpy terrain by driving on the paved paths. Note that we
never told the robot to drive on paths; BADGR automatically learned from the
onboard camera images that driving on concrete paths is smoother than driving
on the grass.

<br />
<i>
BADGR successfully reaches the goal while avoiding collisions, while the
geometry-based policy is unable to make progress because it falsely believes
the grass are untraversable obstacles.
</i>
</p>

We also considered the task of reaching a goal GPS location while avoiding both
collisions and getting stuck in an off-road environment. The geometry-based
policy nearly never crashed or became stuck on grass, but sometimes refused to
move because it was surrounded by grass which it incorrectly labelled as
untraversable obstacles. BADGR almost always succeeded in reaching the goal by
avoiding collisions and getting stuck, while not falsely predicting that all
grass was an obstacle. This is because BADGR learned from experience that most
grass is in fact traversable.

BADGR improving as it gathers more data.
</i>
</p>

In addition to being able to learn about physical attributes of the
environment, a key aspect of BADGR is its ability to continually self-supervise
and improve the model as it gathers more and more data. To demonstrate this
capability, we ran a controlled study in which BADGR gathers and trains on data
from one area, moves to a new target area, fails at navigating in this area,
but then eventually succeeds in the target area after gathering and training on
additional data from that area.

This experiment not only demonstrates that BADGR can improve as it gathers more
data, but also that previously gathered experience can actually accelerate
learning when BADGR encounters a new environment. And as BADGR autonomously
gathers data in more and more environments, it should take less and less time
to successfully learn to navigate in each new environment.

BADGR navigating in novel environments.
</i>
</p>

We also evaluated how well BADGR navigates in novel environments---ranging from
a forest to urban buildings---not seen in the training data. This result
demonstrates that BADGR can generalize to novel environments if it gathers and
trains on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset.

<hr>

The key insight behind BADGR is that by autonomously learning from experience
directly in the real world, BADGR can learn about navigational affordances,
improve as it gathers more data, and generalize to unseen environments.
Although we believe BADGR is a promising step towards a fully automated,
self-improving navigation system, there are a number of open problems which
remain: how can the robot safely gather data in new environments? adapt online
as new data streams in? cope with non-static environments, such as humans
walking around? We believe that solving these and other challenges is crucial
for enabling robot learning platforms to learn and act in the real world.
